            <p class="lead">A version control system is a method of being able to revert files back to a previous state and observe changes in a project as it moves along. One can also go back to an old file if they made a mistake. In web design to work without a version control system is very dangeorous as files could be lost and one may not be able to find out where they made a mistake or go back and fix it. In an area like web design mistakes are bound to happen and to work with a version control system creates a safety net for the designer. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An approach used by many people for version control is to copy files from one directory into another. This approach is risky because one can accidently overwrite files or lose track of the directorires. To solve this issue a local version control system was developed that had a database to manage the files. One popular tool for this is called an RCS. It works by keeping the differnt versions of files in a special format on a disk. It can then recreate the project from any time during its construction. The RCS is still featured and used on operating systems today.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Using a local version control system a developer is limited to themselves. They cannot collaborate with others on their projects. This created a need for centralized version control systems. Centralized version control systems have a databse with versioned files that can be accessed by a number of collaboraters. Using this system there are administrators that control what can and cannot be done and all the collaboraters can know what each other are doing. While this is improved from a local vcs it is not perfect. If the server goes down, no one can work during that time or save what they have been doing. Also if the hard disk is corrupted everything could be lost.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed version control systems are the best and safest option available for version control. In a DVCS the repository is fully mirrored. If any server dies the repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Using these systems one can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways while constructing the same project. Different workflows can be set up than the other version control systems will allow. Some examples of DVCS's are Git and Bazaar. When working with web or graphic design collaboration and safety are two of the most important aspects of the design. A DVCS allows for both these aspects while other version control systems do not.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began as a creation by Linus Torvalds who is the creator of Linux. Starting in 2002 Linux used a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. After 3 years the relationship between the Linux community and the company that created BitKeeper wore away. This made Linux develop their own tool in place of BitKeeper. That tool turned out to be Git. The Linux community wanted Git to have speed, simpleness of design, support for nonlinear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Over the years Git has evolved to be easy to use and very efficient with large projects.</p>
